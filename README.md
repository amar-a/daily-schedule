# Daily Schedule

This app displays the daily schedule for my grade at school. It was built using React and Material UI.

The student's schedule depends on the day (A-H) as well as their periods. The day for a specific date can be found from the school's calendar. The `parse.py` pulls this information and creates a JSON file which is then read by the app.

## User Configuration

To configure, run the app and click on the **Gear** icon in the app bar. The periods are stored in local storage for later access.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
